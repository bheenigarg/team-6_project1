This file uses the following analytic dataset to address several research
questions regarding term deposit subscriptions by clients as a result of a 
marketing campaign.

Dataset Name: bank_data_analytic_file created in external file
STAT6250-01_w17-team-6_project1_data_preparation.sas, which is assumed to be
in the same directory as this file

See included file for dataset properties

"Research Question: Which feature is the biggest contributor to prediction of subscription and how is it related to it?"
;

title2 
"Rationale:  By determining the feature that is the most significant to the success of a campaign and its relation to the outcome, 
            the bank can better understand the causal effects and strategize accordingly."

Methodology: Use PROC LOGISTIC regression to build a model and identify statistically
significant variables;

title1
"Research Question: What are the average number of contacts performed during this and previous campaigns and their impact on the subscriptions?" 
;

title2
"Rationale: This will help the bank identify whether the number of times a client is contacted impacts the campaign outcome and later optimize the number of contacts to 
           achieve highest conversion."

Methodology: Use PROC MEANS to calculate the mean calls for the previous and current
campaign which have resulted in a subscription and then compare the outcomes.
